# My Configurations

I put everything here that’s not private so I can reuse it.

I was inspired by [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

* **R** contains an installation script that I use everywhere. It also contains a script to update all packages.
* **common** contains all my bash-related files.

I haven’t yet created a .osx file in my home directory. I’m still researching the incredible number of options available.

I made symlinks from my home directory into the **common** folder for the bash-related things. This way, I avoid using my home directory as a git repository.
